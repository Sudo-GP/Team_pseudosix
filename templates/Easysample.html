<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">THE
train from 'Frisco was very late. It should have arrived at Hugson's
siding at midnight, but it was already five o'clock and the gray dawn
was breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to
the open shed that served for the station-house. As it came to a stop
the conductor called out in a loud voice:</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&quot;Hugson's
Siding!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">At
once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the
car, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cage
covered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tucked
under her arm. The conductor helped her off the car and then the
engineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned and
moved slowly away up the track. The reason he was so late was because
all through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and
trembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment
the rails might spread apart and an accident happen to his
passengers. So he moved the cars slowly and with caution.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared
around a curve; then she turned to see where she was.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
shed at Hugson's Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and
did not look very inviting. As she peered through the soft gray light
not a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any
person in sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and
buggy standing near a group of trees a short distance away. She
walked toward it and found the horse tied to a tree and standing
motionless, with its head hanging down almost to the ground. It was a
big horse, tall and bony, with long legs and large knees and feet.
She could count his ribs easily where they showed through the skin of
his body, and his head was long and seemed altogether too big for
him, as if it did not fit. His tail was short and scraggly, and his
harness had been broken in many places and fastened together again
with cords and bits of wire. The buggy seemed almost new, for it had
a shiny top and side curtains. Getting around in front, so that she
could look inside, the girl saw a boy curled up on the seat, fast
asleep.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">She
set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol. Presently
he woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes briskly.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&quot;Hello!&quot;
he said, seeing her, &quot;are you Dorothy Gale?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&quot;Yes,&quot;
she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinking gray
eyes. &quot;Have you come to take me to Hugson's Ranch?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&quot;Of
course,&quot; he answered. &quot;Train in?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&quot;I
couldn't be here if it wasn't,&quot; she said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank. Jumping out of
the buggy he put Dorothy's suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage
on the floor in front.</font></font></p>
