Create code for each item on user action list (Objective 4)
Calculate and display reading timetable
Create a weekly notification to allow user to update the app with their progress (ahead/behind or on schedule)
Extension objectives:
• option to create flashcards and notes
• option to import reading list

Brainstorm ideas for actions, initial list below

Find text to use for test – approx. 500 words. Do we want different types (easy/more complex)?

This needs to be done initially and again after weekly update from objective 8
