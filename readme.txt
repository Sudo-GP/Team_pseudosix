Main Aim –
To create a timetable to use when revising using books
Mission Statement –
A tool for determining the timeframe needed in order that you can meet your reading goals

1.	Create a user interface
2.	Design interface (colour/layout/appearance)
3.	Create List of user actions (eg input book etc)
4.	Create a function to do reading test for reading speed
5.	Input book details and find page length from amazon
a.	Investigate code snippets that can do this
6.	Create code for each item on user action list (Objective 4)
7.	Calculate and display reading timetable
8.	Create a weekly notification to allow user to update the app with their progress (ahead/behind or on schedule)

Extension objectives:
•	option to create flashcards and notes 
•	option to import reading list 
•	option to import book (to allow app to calculate based on words rather than pages)

Supplementary notes
1.	Investigate options and decide on most viable
2.	Brainstorm ideas for appearance
3.	Brainstorm ideas for actions, initial list below
a.	how any weeks to revise (initial input)
b.	how many hours to revise per day (initial input)
c.	how many days/week (initial input)
d.	ahead or behind schedule (weekly input)
4.	Find text to use for test – approx. 500 words. Do we want different types (easy/more complex)?
5.	Decide on what details user should input (book title? ISBN?)
6.	Plan the code
7.	Find code snippets methods that do this
8.	This needs to be done initially and again after weekly update from objective 8
